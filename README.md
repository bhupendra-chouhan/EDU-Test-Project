# Peer-to-Peer Payment dApp

## Project Title
Peer-to-Peer Payment dApp

## Project Description
The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Payment dApp is a decentralized application that allows users to make payments directly to each other on the blockchain. Users can deposit funds into the contract, check their balances, and send payments to other users securely.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Peer-to-Peer Payment dApp is to provide a decentralized platform where users can make direct transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. The contract ensures that transactions are secure, transparent, and irreversible, offering a seamless way for users to transfer funds directly to one another.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with ERC-20 tokens**: Expand the dApp to support payments with ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to send a variety of tokens instead of just Ether.
- **Security Enhancements**: Add functionality to prevent re-entrancy attacks and other security vulnerabilities, potentially with features like transaction confirmations.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Develop a frontend dApp with an intuitive UI for users to interact with the smart contract more easily.
- **Transaction History**: Implement a feature to track the transaction history for users, allowing them to review past payments.

## Key Features
- **Deposit Funds**: Users can deposit Ether into the contract, which is then tracked by the contract.
- **Check Balance**: Users can check their current balance within the dApp at any time.
- **Send Payments**: Users can send payments to other users, with the balance updated accordingly for both the sender and receiver.
- **Secure Transactions**: Payments are securely transferred through the blockchain, with each transaction logged and verified.
